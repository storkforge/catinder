# üê± Catinder

Catinder is a group project developed as part of a lab assignment in the course Advanced Java Programming, with a focus on full-stack development using Spring Boot.
The application is a social platform for cat owners, where users can create profiles for their cats, share photos and stories, find local cat meetups, and receive AI-generated recommendations for toys, food, and care tips.

The project also includes a REST API, GraphQL endpoints, and a responsive web interface built with Thymeleaf. It uses role-based authorization, GitHub Actions for CI, and is developed collaboratively by students using Git and GitHub.
